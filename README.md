# Viewer Ftags Chips

_Do you know what ftags (clones, symlinks) are? If not, you should definitely check [this](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load?tab=readme-ov-file#wait-a-minute-what-are-folderindex-notes-what-are-ftags-what-do-you-mean-annexed) out._

Add tag-styled chips on top of each file view in the workspace, representing all the ftags assigned to the file. Immediate parent tags are rendered the brightest and include a button to remove the connection. If removing an ftag leaves the file with no non-inbox ftags, it is sent to the inbox folder.

Higher-level tags ('grandparents') are rendered semi-transparent. The more distant a parent is, the more transparent its chip becomes.

If you have [crosslink-advanced](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-crosslink-advanced) enabled, a button for adding new tags appears to the left of the tags:

Additionally, the plugin adds child chips below the ftag chips.

If the file has more than 5 children, it shows only the first 5 and adds an ellipsis item to show the rest.

You can change how these children are displayed. The plugin settings let you
show them as chips in the top bar (the default), list them inside the Files
panel, or hide them completely.

All chips support tooltips on hover and allow opening the file menu on right-clickâ€”just like file explorer items.

## Disclamer / Safety

This plugin uses certain file system APIs that can modify files, such as writing and moving them. However, it should not make any irreversible changes, as it only moves files and modifies symlinks in notes' frontmatter. That said, always [back up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#:~:text=3-2-1%20rule) your vault whether you use this plugin or not.

## Contributing

Issues and patches are welcome. This plugin is designed to work alongside other plugins, and I will do my best to support such use cases. However, I retain the right to refuse support for any given plugin at my discretion.
